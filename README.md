## vim

I have used TextMate for the last nine years (since 2011-04) and still like it very much - especially the multiple cursor support.
Reasons to try the slow process of switching to vim:

- the same editor locally & on the server
- I'd be free to move away from macOS
- Language Server Protocol plugins
- hopefully, sometime: incredible editing speed
- also, TextMate seems to be requiring macOS 10.14 in the future, my MacBook is “vintage” and only runs 10.13
